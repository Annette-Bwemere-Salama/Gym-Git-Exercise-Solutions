    <p>FreshBooks is an accounting software for small and medium-sized businesses. And the site’s homepage makes the
        company’s
        mission clear. The page lays out FreshBooks’ features so visitors can quickly understand what they stand to gain
        from
        trying the tool out.

        There’s a great use of contrast and positioning with the primary calls-to-action. It’s clear the company wants
        you to
        convert when you arrive. “Try for Free” is also a very compelling CTA.

        What we love: FreshBooks uses customer testimonials to tell real-world stories of customer success. They also
        employ
        social proof by including star ratings from third-party sites.</p>
